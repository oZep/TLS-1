1.  In the Unity editor, navigate to **Tools** in the top menu bar.
2.  Go to **Igloo** and click on **Settings Wizard**.
3.  Close the Settings Wizard window.
4.  Repeat steps 1-3 one more time.
5.  After running the wizard twice, go back to **Tools** > **Igloo** and click on **Settings Wizard** again.
6.  This time, within the Settings Wizard, click the **"Spawn Igloo Manager"** button.

### 4. Open the Spout Receiver Demo

1.  In the Unity Project window, navigate to the following path:
    `SPOUT_2007-016/SPOUT-2007/DEMO`
2.  Open the **SpoutReciever** scene.
